Day 0: PlayWright Setup
	npm - Node packaging manager
	Q: Different ways we can install sowftware
	Ans: 1. npn install <<library name>>
		2. npn i <<library name>>
		3. npn init <<library name (Recomended)>>
		
	Installing Playwrigt
	1. npm init playwright (installs latest version)
	2. npm init playwright@1.56.1 (Install Specific version)
	3. npm init playwright@latest (install latest version)
	3. npm init playwright@latest (install latest version)
		
	Commands will use in PlayWright
	1. npx playwright test - to run end to end test
	2. npx playwright test --ui - Start the interactive UI mode
	3. npx playwright test --project=chromium - Runs the test only on Desktop chromium
	4. npx playwright test --example - runs the test in specific file
	5. npx playwright test --debug - Run test in debug mode
	6. npx playwright test codegen - auto generate test with codegen
	
	PlayWright file details
	1. github\workflows - this files contains the pipeline details linked to Github. all the tasks mentioned what to do when new DEV codebase is pushed to github
	2. node_modules - it is the heart of the module. when we install playwright, this file will be created. if this file is deleted. Playwright will not work.
		"./node_modules\playwright\test.mjs" this file contains list of all the files which we can import based on the need.
	3. tests - this is the default location to write test scripts
	4. tests-examples - contains sample tests 
	5. .gitignore - Here we can mentions all the files which should not to pushed to GitHub.
	6. package-lock.json - This files provides all the details of the playwright installation and dependencies done so far
	7. package.json - This file is used to control the execution flow. something like regression suite.
		"scripts": {} - This if where we will mention the execution flow
	8. playwright.config.ts - Most important file. Most of the settings we will do in this file like headless mode, parallel execution etc.
		 This will be explained in next session/video.
	
	
	For any authorization for playWright, use below command
		set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser
		-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
		
	Important files to refer in Playwright framework
	1. PlayWrght_Proj_JSTS\node_modules\playwright\test.mjs
	2. PlayWrght_Proj_JSTS\tests\example.spec.ts
	
Day 1:	Understanding Playwright configuration and Parallel testing
	List of parameters we work with in this file
	1. import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test'
		In order to work with below parameters, we need to import respective packages/modules.
		defineConfig & devices are mentioned in "./node_modules\playwright\test.mjs" file
		
	2. testDir
		Path of the test script files. when we execute "npx playwright test" command, then playwright will execute 
		all the test cases written under this path.

	4. forbidOnly
		if you are running scripts via CICD pipeline then in that case if anywhere if "this.only" is mentiond in any
		of the test case then that particular test case will execute but the execution will fail. because regression
		suite means executing multiple test cases, not only one test case.
	5. retries
		you can mention how many times you want to re-execute the failed test cases
	
	7. reporter - type of report you want to generate (html/list/dot/line/github/json/junit/null)
	
	8. Use - Play applies all the properties/settings inside this USE to each test case.
		NOTE - what ever settings or rules you want to set at each test case level, need to be mentioned under "USE" 
		keyword. "USE" keyword is also available under "Project"
		
		trace - off/on/on-first-retry/on-all-retries/retain-on-failure/retain-on-first-failure
		screenshot - off/on/only-on-failure/on-first-failure
		video - off/on/retain-on-failure/on-first-retry
		headless - true/false (by default is is TRUE)
		
	9. projects - Browser details which Playwright supports (it supports 7 types of brwosers)
	
	3. fullyParallel
	6. workers - describes how many test case should run in parallel
		
Day 2: Understanding Playwright Architecture, Test annotation and async-await concept
		Playwright uses WebSockets to communicate with Browser
		
		************ Incomplete ************
Day 3: Browser & Page fixture
	Q: What is the difference between Browser & Page fixture
	Ans : 1. Browser fixture will launch Browser only where as Page fixture will launch browser and page
			2. Using Browser we can launch multiple pages on same broser context where as using page we can launch only one page
			3. to do brwoser level settings we need to use Browser fixture only
			4. if we use browser fixture, then we need to create instance of both browser and page inside the test function where as
				if we use page fixture, then no need to create instance of either of them.
	Q: Where to find different version of Playwritht
	Ans : Search for "Playwright version history" in google and select "release note" (playwright.dev/docs/release-notes)

	Q. What is the use of a FIXTURE
	Ans-Fixtures are playwright features which performs certain actions without being called such as 
		Browser fixer will launch the browser without calling it and also closes the browser at the end
		of the execution automatically 

	Q. How to run a test
	Ans - npx playwright test "test file name including the extension"
					e.g - npx playwright test "TestScript.spec.ts"

	Q. How to create browser and page context
	Ans - const browsercontxt = browser.newContext()
    		const pagecontxt = (await browsercontxt).newPage()
	
	Q. Command to view the report
	Ans - npx playwright show-report

Day 4: Locators - Understanding CSS Selector to write the Locator
	Types of locators
	1. Playwright specific locators (1st preference) 
	2. CSS Selector (2nd Preference)
	3. Xpath (least preference)
	
	CSS Selector:
	1. id (#<<Id Value>>)
		Syntax:
			a. tagname#idvalue
			b. #idvalue
			c. [id='value']
		NOTE - is the locator is found under <Script> tab then ingnore that locator
	2. class (.<<attribute value>>)
			Syntax:
				a. .ClassValue
				b. .ClassValue.ClassValue (if multiple class values are availabel for the object)
				c. tagname.Classvalue
				d. [class='classvalue']

	3. any attribute ([attribute name='attribute value'])
			Syntax:
			a. TagName[attributeName='AttributeValue']
			b. [attributeName='AttributeValue']
			
	4. Write CSS traversing from Parent to child
			1. Parent locator <Single SPACE> Cild Locator....
			2. page.Locator(.classvalue).first().click
				page.Locator(.classValue).last().click
				page.Locator(.classvalue).nth(4).click (Index starts from 0)
			NOTE - Playwright wont support child to parent approach and also it wont support traversing to siblings

Day 5 - Understanding xpath and Playwright specific getBy locators
	Locators using XPath
			1. //*[@attributeName='attributeValue'] (//* - this will start searching from top)
				e.g - //*[@id='password']
			2. //tagname[@attributeName='attributeValue'] (//tagname - this will start searching from the first occurance of the mentioned tag)
				e.g - //input[@id='password']
					//input[@id='password'][2] (2 is an index)
					NOTE :
						1. in XPath index starts with 1
						2. in XPath if we are using class value as a locator then we need to provide all the class values given for that particular object

			3. Parent to child
				a. Parent to first child
					//tagname[@attributeName = 'attributevalue']/child object locator
					e.g - //div[@class = 'practive-form']/label
				b. Parent to any child
					//tagname[@attributeName = 'attributevalue']//child object locator
					e.g - //div[@class = 'practive-form']//label
			4. identifying following and preceeding sibling
							//tagname[@attributename = 'attributevalue']//following-sibling::child object locator
							e.g - //label[@for='username']//following-sipling::label

							//tagname[@attributename = 'attributevalue']//preceding-sibling::child object locator
							e.g - //label[@for='username']//preceding-sipling::label
			5.Child to parent
							//tagname[@attributename = 'attributevalue']//parent::parent object locator
							e.g - //label[@for='username']//parent::div
			6. Child to grand parent
							//tagname[@attributename = 'attributevalue']//ancestor::grandparent object locator
							e.g - //label[@for='username']//ancestor::section[2]
			7. Identifying by text value
							//tagname[text()='text value']
							//tagname[text()='text value'][2]
							//tagname[contains(text(),'text value')]
							//*[contains(text(),'text value')]

	PlayWright Build-In locators
		Playwright has 7 build-in locators
			1. getByRole ---> identify the element based on the role
			2. getByText ---> identify the element with its text
			3. getByPlaceholder ---> identify element using 'placeholder' arrtibute. this attribute is available only for text box.
			4. getByTestId ---> identify element using 'data-testid' attribute.
			5. getByAltText ---> Inentify image element using 'Alt' attribute
			6. getByTitle ---> identify element using 'Title' attribute
			7. getByLabel ---> identify element using 'label' tag

			1. getByRole
			2. getByText
				a. getByText('expected string') ---> this will verify instring
				b. getByText('expected string', {exact: true}) ---> this will verify exact match
			3. getByPlaceholder
				getByPlaceholder('place holder value')
			4. getByTestId
				getByyTestId('test id value')
			5. getByAltText
				getByAltText('value of Alt attribute')
			6. getByTitle
				getByTitle('value of Title attribute')
			7. getByLabel
				we use this method in 2 situations
				a. when you have 'for' as an attribute for an element that have been developped using 'label' tag.
					getBylabel('lable text')
				b. when you find <input> tag inside 'label' tag element

				NOTE - In the UI, for any text field when you click on the label next to the specific text/edit field and the 
					curser blinkas in the text/edit field then we can use this method

  

Day Playwrite archetecture
	Playwrite works on websocket archetecture instead of HTTP

Questions:
1. what is the difference between "async function" and function
		function add(a:number, func:Function)
			{
				console.log("Sum of 3 numbers - ", a + await func(20,30))
			}
				
		add(10, function(b: number, c: number){return b + c }) ----------------O/P - 60
		add(12, async function(b: number, c: number){return b + c }) ----------O/P - 12[object Promise]

2. what is the difference between below two flows
	function add(a:number, func:Function)
 				{
 					const b = 20
 					const c = 30
 					console.log("Sum of 3 numbers - ", a + func(20,30))
 				}
				
	a. add(10, function (b: number, c: number){return b + c })
		
	b. add(10, function name1(b: number, c: number){return b + c })
				
3. what is the difference between adding ";" and not adding ";"
		e.g. - Console.log("Hi")
				Console.log("Hi");
				
4. What is the difference between "Named function" and anonymous function (when assigned it to a variable as shown below)
	a. function add(a,b)
		{
			console.log(a+b)
		}
	b. let add = function(a,b)
				{
					console.log(a+b)
				}
				
4. What is GoCodeo-Build which is displayed in your editor.

5. Do we have multidimention array consept
6. What is the different ...Rest Parameter and array/any parameter
7. Short cut for console.log
